'''After ascending a crescent shaped, red-carpeted stair you  among white marble statues, you 
enter the dazzling main hall of Piergeironâ€™s Palace. The vaulted ceiling rises high above you and beneath it, 
floating unsupported are several massive crystal chandeliers, shining a pure white light. A three huge windows 
made of single plates of crystal are curtained in the finest white gauze and by them immense stone amphoras of 
the most exotic wines. Stewards carrying huge plates of food are moving slowly among the crowd of assembled nobles. 
In a semi circle against the far wall in the centre of the room, there is a sectioned area which separates those of 
lesser note from the great. Against the wall under a golden canopy is the throne of Piergeiron, and on it rests his 
huge mace of office. Manturov is already talking to several impressively bejeweled people, one of whom is completely 
covered in a heavy black robe with black gloves, wearing a glassy obsidian mask. From reputation, you recognise this 
as one of the masked lords of Waterdeep.'''.replace("\n","").split(" ")
